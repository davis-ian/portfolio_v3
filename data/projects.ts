      <p>
        <strong>Forma</strong> is a real-time, action roguelite game built entirely in JavaScript using <strong>Three.js</strong>
        and a custom-built <strong>Entity Component System (ECS)</strong> architecture. The game blends smooth 2D sprite aesthetics
        with a fully dynamic 3D world, enabling tight control over animation timing, hitbox precision, and camera effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project was designed not only as a gameplay prototype, but as a demonstration of clean system architecture,
        ECS design principles, and performant render pipelines using raw Three.js and GLSL shaders. The ECS system supports
        full modularity, real-time combat, damage systems, AI pathfinding, room generation, and debugging tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        I built Forma to challenge myself to apply <strong>FAANG-level engineering patterns</strong> in a creative domain,
        prioritizing clean separation of concerns, system debuggability, and maintainability at scale. All animations, physics,
        enemy behavior, and effects are managed through ECS-driven update cycles.

        <strong>Minigames</strong> is a growing suite of playful browser-based games built to explore interactive UI,

        component with smooth animations, sound effects, and clean game loop logic.

        This project serves as a creative sandbox to test modern frontend patterns like global state management with <strong>Pinia</strong>,
        reactivity handling in game loops, and performance optimization in real-time interactions.
        It‚Äôs also a visual playground ‚Äî each game is styled using <strong>TailwindCSS</strong> and adapts to mobile and desktop layouts.

        Beyond prototyping game logic, the goal was to write production-quality component structure for each game,

        This project explores the potential of high-performance native tools like FFmpeg being ported to the web.
